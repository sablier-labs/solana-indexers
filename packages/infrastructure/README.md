## `graph-node` | Graph Node Local Development

If you are developing a Substreams-powered subgraph, you can use the local Docker set-up to test the indexing locally.

### Docker Compose

- `./start.sh` will reference `docker-compose`. For more recent versions of Docker, please make sure it's edited to `docker compose`.
